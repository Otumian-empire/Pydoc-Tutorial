# iterations is just like loops
mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# for i in mylist:
#     print(i)

# note that for actually calls the iter() and __next__() -> next()
# iterthe 2nd arg tells iter to return the next item
it_mylist = iter(mylist)
# print(next(it_mylist))
# print(next(it_mylist))
# print(next(it_mylist))
# print(next(it_mylist))
